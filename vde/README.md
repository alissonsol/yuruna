# Virtual Development Environment (VDE)

Your first task is to establish a **Virtual Development Environment (VDE)**. The VDE gives you a consistent, reproducible workspace that mirrors our target platforms.

Pick the environment that matches your host machine and follow the linked instructions to create your first VM.

- Setup a VDE on a [Windows Hyper-V host](windows-hyper-v.host.md)
- Setup a VDE on a [macOS UTM host](macos.utm.host.md)

## Post-VDE Setup

Once your base VDE is running, proceed to the [Post-VDE Setup](scripts.guest/README.md) instructions to quickly download and execute scripts in the guest environment, which will install additional tools and services such as OpenClaw, Visual Studio Code, and more.
