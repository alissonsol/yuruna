# Setup a VDE on a Windows Hyper-V Host

Complete the [Windows Hyper-V Host](windows.hyper-v.host/README.md) setup first, then follow the instructions for your guest operating system:

- [Amazon Linux](windows.hyper-v.host/amazon.linux.guest/README.md) guest
- [Ubuntu Desktop](windows.hyper-v.host/ubuntu.desktop.guest/README.md) guest

## Post-VDE Setup

Once your base VDE is running, proceed to the [Post-VDE Setup](scripts.guest/README.md) instructions to install additional tools and services in the guest environment.
