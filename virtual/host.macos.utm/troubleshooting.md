# macOS UTM Host Troubleshooting

**Warning:** This is not a section for everyone. Instructions are intentionally brief — don't follow them unless you know what you are doing!

## Packages, PATH, and Homebrew issues

- Packages not installed via `Homebrew` (e.g. PowerShell) won't be updated by `brew update` / `brew upgrade` cycles.
- Packages installed by different methods can shadow each other via PATH order ([DLL hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLL_hell) has company!).
- For most of those situations, use `brew-doctor-fix.sh`.
- Occasionally you may still need manual steps, e.g. `brew uninstall powershell` followed by `brew install powershell`.

## Cleaning Up Old Files

- Run `Remove-OrphanedVMFiles.ps1`.
- Note: this removes any files not associated with existing VMs, including downloaded base images — you would then need to re-run the relevant `Get-Image.ps1` scripts.

## `waitForAndClickButton` loops on "UTM window for `<vm>` not found"

Symptom: the first OCR step (e.g. "Try or Install Ubuntu") matches and
steps succeed, then a later `waitForAndClickButton` warns repeatedly:

```
WARNING: UTM window for 'test-…' not found (CG query returned: not_found).
  Open the VM in UTM.app before using waitForAndClickButton.
DEBUG:   Window capture unavailable — retrying
```

Two possible causes:

1. **Terminal is missing Screen Recording permission.**
   `CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo` strips window titles when the caller
   lacks this TCC grant. Region-capture OCR (the earlier steps) still
   works because it falls back to AppleScript via Accessibility — a
   different TCC bucket.

2. **UTM's VM window has `NSWindowSharingNone`** (observed on some
   UTM + Apple Virtualization builds). The window is reachable via
   the Accessibility API but omits `kCGWindowName` from CGWindowList
   regardless of Screen Recording state. Current builds of the
   harness auto-fall-back to AppleScript bounds in this case — you
   will see `CG window query: not_found` followed by
   `Window bounds query (fallback): <x>,<y>,<w>,<h>` in debug output.

Fix for (1):

1. System Settings → Privacy & Security → **Screen Recording** →
   enable your terminal (Terminal.app, iTerm2, Ghostty, etc.).
2. **Fully quit** the terminal (Cmd-Q — not just close the window)
   and relaunch. TCC grants don't apply to a running process.
3. Re-run the harness.

Case (2) needs no user action — the AppleScript fallback fires
automatically. If `Window bounds query (fallback)` also returns
`not_found`, UTM's window isn't actually open: double-click the
`.utm` bundle or click the VM in UTM.app's sidebar so a display
window exists.

## `screencapture -l` returns black, or "UTM window for `<vm>` not found", on a different macOS Space

If you switched to a different Space (e.g. to debug in VS Code) and
the runner started failing screen captures or window-id lookups,
make sure the harness is up to date:

- The window-finder JXA in
  [`Test.Screenshot.psm1`](../../test/modules/Test.Screenshot.psm1)
  must use `kCGWindowListOptionAll` (not `OnScreenOnly`); only
  `OptionAll` enumerates UTM windows that live on another Space.
- `Enable-TestAutomation.ps1` must have flipped
  `AppleSpacesSwitchOnActivation` to `false`. Verify with:

  ```bash
  defaults read NSGlobalDomain AppleSpacesSwitchOnActivation
  ```

  If it returns `1` or "does not exist", re-run
  `pwsh ./Enable-TestAutomation.ps1`.

- Right-click UTM in the Dock → Options → Assign To → All Desktops.
  This pins UTM windows on every Space so the lookup, capture, and
  AVF-guest keystroke paths all work uniformly. The script
  intentionally does not script this (Dock plist edits are fragile).

QEMU+VNC guests (e.g. `guest.ubuntu.desktop`) are Space-independent
end-to-end and need none of the above.

## `Assert-ScreenRecording` false positive — toggle IS on but harness refuses to start

If System Settings shows the toggle ON for your terminal, you've
fully quit and relaunched (or rebooted), and
`Invoke-TestRunner.ps1` still refuses to start with "Screen Recording
is not granted", the probe itself is misreporting state.

Confirm with the ground-truth JXA call:

```bash
osascript -l JavaScript -e '
ObjC.import("CoreGraphics");
ObjC.bindFunction("CGPreflightScreenCaptureAccess", ["bool", []]);
$.CGPreflightScreenCaptureAccess();'
```

If that prints `true`, the grant is in place and the harness probe
is wrong for your macOS version. As a temporary workaround, set:

```bash
export YURUNA_SKIP_SCREEN_RECORDING_CHECK=1
pwsh test/Invoke-TestRunner.ps1
```

Then please open an issue with:
- Output of `sw_vers -productVersion`
- Output of `echo $TERM_PROGRAM $TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION`
- Output of the JXA command above
- Output of
  ```bash
  osascript -l JavaScript -e '
  ObjC.import("CoreGraphics"); ObjC.import("Foundation");
  var n = $.CFArrayGetCount($.CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo(1, 0));
  n;'
  ```
